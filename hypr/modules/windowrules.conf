# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/ for more
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/ for workspace rules

# Rationale: This rule tells Hyprland to ignore requests from *any* application
#            (class:.*) to both maximize or go into a true fullscreen state.
#            This gives you, the user, full control over window sizing and
#            prevents applications from unexpectedly taking over your screen.
#            It's especially useful in a tiling window manager where you prefer
#            manual window management.
windowrulev2 = suppressevent maximize fullscreen, class:.*


# === SCRATCHPAD CONFIGURATION (Managed by Pyprland) ===
# Rationale: Scratchpads are now handled by Pyprland for enhanced functionality,
#            such as auto-launching applications if they aren't already running.
#            Pyprland defines and manages the special workspace logic internally.

# This native Hyprland scratchpad rule is no longer needed when using Pyprland,
# as Pyprland manages the window's assignment to the 'special' workspace.
# Keeping it commented out prevents potential conflicts.
# windowrulev2 = workspace special silent, class:^(kitty)$


# Example windowrule v1 (keep commented out unless you intend to use it)
# windowrule = float, ^(kitty)$

# Example windowrule v2 (keep commented out unless you intend to use it)
#windowrulev2 = float,class:^(kitty)$,title:^(kitty)$

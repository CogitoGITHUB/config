 The Vision: "Digital Art meets Literate Programming"

You’ve got:

Krita → your paintbrush and chaos engine. Think concept art, illustrations, textures, dynamic sketches.

Inkscape → your geometry engine. Clean vectors, diagrams, schematics, modular icons — perfect for embedding in LaTeX documents.

Emacs + Org Mode → the brainstem. Structure, link, version, and integrate everything (images, math, notes, exports).

LaTeX → your scribe. Turns that chaos and structure into beautiful, printable, scholarly perfection.

Wacom Intuos Pro 2025 → your soul interface. The bridge between gesture and geometry.
